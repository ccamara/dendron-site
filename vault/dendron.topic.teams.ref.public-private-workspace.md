## Workspace

We recommend getting started by using the example in our [GitHub template](https://github.com/dendronhq/template.engineering-team-workspace). 

This will create a workspace with the following structure

```
.
└── workspace
    ├── org-private
    │   └── notes
    │       └── ...
    ├── org-public
    │   └── notes
    │       └── ...
    └── org-dev
        └── notes
            └── ...
```

## Vaults

### main
- org-private: 
  - for company private notes (eg. roadmap, projects, meetings)
- org-public: 
  - for public notes (eg. wiki, blog, faq)
- org-dev: 
  - for developer related notes (eg. coding guidelines, docs, rfcs)
